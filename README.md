# To-Do-App

I have used vanilla javascript to build this todo App
WHat I learnt :
1) concept of localStorgae in the developer tools of google chrome (setItem and getItem method)
2) setItem()=> store data in localstorage
3) getItem()=>  retirieve data from localstorage and displays it
4) appendChild()
5) use of ::before in the css
